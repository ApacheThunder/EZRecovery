# EZRecovery: DS Mode FW Updator for EZ Flash Omega and Omega Definitive Edition

Currently in initial testing phase. Do not use if you don't have a bricked unit!

This is a DS/DS Lite homebrew program and thus requires a DS/DS Lite to use!


Definition Edition is expected to be built using -D_DEBUILD compile flag in arm9 makefile.
Please use banner_de.bin in place of normal one when compiling DE build.

There currently isn't an easy method to detect a DE card from a regular unit so a unified build is not currently safe to use.
